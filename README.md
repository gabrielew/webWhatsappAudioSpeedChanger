## A chrome extension to change web whatsapp audio speed to 2x

<p> This extension is for those who don't like to listen to five-minute audios every time, so next to the profile photo a 2x button will appear, <strong>and even better</strong>, you won't have to worry about changing the speed all the time, the state will be saved after your first choice! </p>


<p>The extension is already available in the official site to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-BR/firefox/addon/web-whatsapp-audio-speedchange/"><strong>Mozilla</strong></a> and <a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/web-whatsapp-audio-speed-/ebgmnpekcnbhooilagcjbncdkcppolnl?hl=pt-BR"><strong>Microsoft Edge (based on Chromium)</strong></a>, you can download anytime! </p>

<p>Unfortunately the extension isn't available in the official site in <strong>Google Chrome</strong>, even so you can use! You will need to clone or download the project and drag the folder to <strong>chrome://extensions</strong>, remember to active developer mode in the right side header menu. </p>
